Scripts for webpage:

	What we need to make happen on the webpage:
		.Bottom navigation automatic scroll with mouse
		.About-us scroll animation.
		.Movement of balls when you access second level
		.Make balls bigger when mouse on top -> can be made on css, dimish loading times
		.Make creamos y formamos go bigger on main menu
		.Transition between main and 2nd level (and the other way around)
		.Transition between 2nd level and 3rd level (and the other way around)
		.Make external liks open in separate page
		.Lines between elements on second level
		.See more option
		.Loading animation
		.Connected cloud of Acelerados -> when created add a button in front of the bottom navigation thingy to access it 
										directly (Must be fixed so you can always access it)
		.Make and or add arrows to move around inside About-us
		.Add animations to side menu so balls will move when clicked, or to show where inside there you are
		.Add animations to main page to make it prettier and more user friendly
		.Add video links and embeds
		.Add embeds to about-us
		.Add floating moving balls on the main menu
		.Animations in Los Patriotas to make it cool looking
		.Change labs to make them look way cooler (We have them backgrounds, it can be done)


	Numbers indicate order of priority (time it takes to make it happen may influence order):
		Priorities: 
			1.Add video links and embeds
			2.Make creamos y formamos go bigger on main menu
			3.Bottom navigation automatic scroll with mouse
			
		Important but no so much:
			1.Make external liks open in separate page
			2.See more option
			3.Add embeds to about-us
			4.About-us scroll animation.
			5.Make and or add arrows to move around inside About-us
			6.Movement of balls when you access second level
			
		Would be good:
			1.Change labs to make them look way cooler (We have them backgrounds, it can be done)
			2.Lines between elements on second level
			3.Transition between main and 2nd level (and the other way around)
			4.Transition between 2nd level and 3rd level (and the other way around)
			5.Connected cloud of Acelerados -> when created add a button in front of the bottom navigation thingy to access 									it directly (Must be fixed so you can always access it)
		Just because it'll be cool:
			1.Make balls bigger when mouse on top -> can be made on css, dimish loading times
			2.Add animations to main page to make it prettier and more user friendly
			3.Animations in Los Patriotas to make it cool looking
			4.Add floating moving balls on the main menu
